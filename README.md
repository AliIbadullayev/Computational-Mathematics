# Computational-Mathematics
 Here is lab of this discipline and some goodies
* 1-st Lab is about **Gausse method** (straight stroke and reverse stroke) 
* 2-nd Lab is about non-linear equations with **Half Division** and **Simple Iteration** methods
* 3-rd Lab is about integral finding with **Simpsons** and **Trapezium** methods
* 4-th Lab is about approximation according to different functions (**linear, 2nd and 3rd polynom, exponential, power, logarithm**)
* 5-th Lab is about interpolation using methods of **Newton** and **LaGrange**
* 6-th Lab is about differential equations solution with **Eiler** (one-step) and **Miln** (multi-steps) methods
